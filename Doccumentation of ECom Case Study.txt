OBJECTIVE
By analysing customer behaviour data with Power BI, we can gain valuable insights into e-commerce operations.  The resulting dashboards empower stakeholders to optimise marketing strategies, improve product performance, and drive business growth.

DATA CLEANING 
TASK 1: Understanding the Data
	
	Sales_Data_Ecommerce
		Key attributes:
			event_type: Indicates whether the user viewed, added to a cart, or 				    purchased a product.
			price: Price of the product. 
			brand, category, sub_category: Information about the product.
			event_date, event_time, event_hour: Timestamp of the event.
			channel: Whether the customer used an app or browser.
			state, user_id, user_score: Customer-related information.	 	Promotions Dataset
		Key attributes:
			Promotion ID
			Date: When the promotion was active.
			Discount %
			Product ID: Which product was promoted?

TASK 2: Configure the Data 

- Imported `Sales_Data_Ecommerce` and `Promotions` datasets into **Power Query Editor**.
- Checked data preview to understand structure.
- Analyze duplicates to understand:
		a. Are they due to multiple events for the same user?
		b. Are they duplicate rows with identical information?
		c. Are there multiple promotions for the same product?
-Outliers
	Do you want to remove, replace, or keep outliers for further analysis?
	Should we apply both IQR and Z-Score methods and compare the results?

TASK 3: Data Checks and Validation

Sales_Data_Ecommerce dataset
	
1. Check for Nulls and Duplicates
2. Removed column event_timezone (contained only a single value for all the records)
3. Removed Duplicated rows based on:
	-user_id, transaction_id (new column created)
4. Change the Data Type Formats of the columns to the suitable data types 
	-Changed data type of price to decimal 
5. Extracted event_month from event_date to compare revenue months.
6. Handled Text Inconsistencies or Standardization
	-Trim and clean category, sub_category1, sub_category2, and brand:
	-Use Transform → Format → Trim & Clean.
	-Convert the above column names to Proper Case (e.g., "apple" → "Apple").
7. Created a new column called Transaction_Id by combining user_id, event_date, and product_id to uniquely identify and track the data of sales. 
8. Created a new column called Hour Group that groups hours into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.
9. Created a new column called High-Value Transactions Column
	- Define a threshold (e.g., Top 10% of prices).
	- Create a conditional column: If price > threshold, label it "High-Value 		Purchase". Otherwise, label it as "Regular Purchase".
10. Created a new column called Revenue for purchase-only event type.


Promotion dataset

1. Keep the columns
2. The tables "sales" and "promotion" were merged using Right Join. This allows us to analyze how promotions affect sales and customer behaviour.
3. Removed blank rows.
4. Removed duplicated rows
7. Removed null values based on product id.
5. Created a new column called Promotion Flag based on Discount as promoted or not promoted
6. Created a new column called Discounted_price for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. What key trends do you expect to see in the data?

- Sales Trends: Identify top-selling products, brands, and categories over time.
- Customer Behavior: Track how users navigate the site (viewing, carting, purchasing).
- Conversion Funnel Analysis: Understand where customers drop off.
- Regional Performance: Identify which states drive the most and least revenue.
- Peak Shopping Times: Determine the most active hours/days for sales.
- Brand Engagement: Which brands/products have the highest user interactions?

2. Do you want to analyze customer journey behavior, conversion rates, and peak times?
Yes, a customer journey analysis is crucial to understanding:

- How many users view a product but don’t purchase?
- Where do customers drop off in the purchase funnel?
- Which time periods have the highest and lowest sales?
- We can analyze conversion rates by tracking:

View → Cart → Purchase drop-offs.
Cart abandonment rate to identify lost revenue opportunities.

3. How should we visualize initial findings before moving to dashboard creation?
Before building dashboards, we can use:

- Histograms & Box Plots for user session durations and purchase behavior.
- Bar Charts for sales by category, state, and brand.
- Funnel Charts for the customer journey (view → cart → purchase).
- Heatmaps for peak purchase times by hour and day.
- Scatter Plots to find relationships between discounts and conversions.

4. What is your main goal with this dashboard?
The dashboard should focus on all key aspects:

- Sales Trends – Revenue, top-selling products, and peak sales periods.
- User Behavior – How customers navigate, bounce rates, and drop-offs.
- Product Performance – Which brands/categories drive engagement and revenue.

This will help in making data-driven decisions for marketing, pricing, and inventory.

5. Who will use this dashboard?
The primary users will be:

- Marketing Teams – To optimize conversion rates and campaigns.
- Product Managers – To understand product demand and user engagement.
- Executives & Stakeholders – To track overall revenue and business health.

6. What insights would be the most useful for decision-making?
We should prioritize:

- Conversion Rates & Drop-off Analysis – Identify where users abandon purchases.
- Revenue Trends – Monthly and yearly sales performance.
- Discount Effectiveness – Do discounts lead to higher conversions?
- Product & Brand Performance – Which products drive the most revenue?
- Regional Sales Insights – Where should marketing efforts be focused?

	Offer location-specific promotions.

Conclusion:
	- Apple & Samsung lead the e-commerce market, but customer drop-off from viewing to 	  purchasing needs attention.

Insights from E-commerce Data Analysis
1. How do different user scores affect purchase behavior?
	- Users with higher scores (loyalty points, reviews, or engagement levels) tend to       	  have higher purchase frequency and larger order values.
	- Low-score users may engage less and abandon carts more often.
	- Actionable Insight: Offer personalized promotions or discounts to lower-score   	  users to increase conversions.

2. Which states have the highest revenue and most engaged users?
	- States with the highest revenue usually have a larger customer base, higher 		  disposable income, or stronger brand presence.
	- Engagement metrics (click-through rates, repeat visits, session duration) help 	  identify states where users browse frequently but may not convert.
	-Actionable Insight: Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue states and run re- 	 engagement campaigns for states with high engagement but lower purchases.

3. What are the best-selling products and least-performing ones?
	-Best-sellers: Frequently discounted, high-rated, or trending products.
	-Least-performing products: Items with low visibility, higher prices, or limited 	 stock availability.

	- Actionable Insight: Improve content, run influencer campaigns, or bundle low-	 	  engagement brands with popular ones.

5. Is there a difference in conversion rate between users on the app vs. the browser?
	- App users usually have higher conversion rates due to a smoother user experience, 	  push notifications, and saved payment details.
	- Browser users may drop off due to friction in checkout or lack of login benefits.
	- Actionable Insight: Improve mobile responsiveness for web users and offer 	  	  incentives for first-time app downloads.

6. What is the customer segmentation based on purchase behavior?
	-High-value customers: Frequent buyers with high-order values.
	-One-time buyers: Customers who made a single purchase and never returned.
